abstract: Here, 44 floodplain aggradation cycles were mapped and measured in 3-D using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to develop a photogrammetric model covering a geographic area of ~10 km2 and spanning a stratigraphic succession of ~300 m. The 44 cycles have an average thickness of 6.8 m with a standard deviation of 2.0 m, which is in line with previous studies. Most cycles are consistently traceable over the entire model, indicating spatial consistency and in line with allogenic climate forcing by the astronomical precession cycle. Individual floodplain aggradation cycles may change in thickness rapidly when traced laterally, with rates up to 1 m over a lateral distance of 100 m and a maximum of 4 m. Detailed mapping of seven successive cycles reveals differences in their regionally-averaged thicknesses of 3.7 m to 9.7 m, with their coefficients of variation ranging between 17% and 28%. Variogram analysis demonstrates that the thickness of a cycle at one locality is statistically related to that at another locality over an average distance of 1.3 km in the paleoflow direction and 0.6 km perpendicular to the paleoflow direction. These different directional trends are interpreted to result from morphological elements oriented in paleoflow directions in the fluvial landscapes shaping more consistency of the sedimentary elements in paleoflow direction. Two different metrics suggest that full-compensational stacking occurs after deposition of 6 to 7 cycles, or timescales of ca. 120 to 140 kyr, although strong thickness compensation is shown to start at the subsequent one and two floodplain aggradation cycles, so at ca. 20-40 kyr time scales.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
